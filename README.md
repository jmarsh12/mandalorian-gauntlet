DIY Arduino Mandalorian gauntlet display

Companion to my mandalorian range finder project located here: https://github.com/jmarsh12/mandalorian-rangefinder

I wanted to make a gauntlet display that shows different data screens that a mandalorian might have. Things like rocket ammo, shields, chain code, etc.
This project has 10 screens, chain code, rocket ammo, shield status, text translation, data transmission, flamethrower temperature, grappling hook range,
jetpack status, targeting system, and power status. It cycles through each screen beginning with the chain code.

Feel free to adjust or change screens as needed.
